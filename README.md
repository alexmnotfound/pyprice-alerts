Price Alert System

The Price Alert System is a Python script that enables users to track cryptocurrency prices and receive alerts when the prices reach certain thresholds. The script integrates with Google Sheets and Binance API to fetch and compare cryptocurrency prices. Users can input their desired cryptocurrency symbols and target prices in a Google Spreadsheet, and the script periodically checks the current prices on Binance. Once a target price is reached, the system sends an alert message via Telegram to notify the user. The project leverages gspread library for Google Sheets integration, python-telegram-bot library for Telegram communication, and requests library for making HTTP requests to the Binance API.

The Price Alert System provides a convenient way for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to stay informed about price movements and make timely investment decisions.
